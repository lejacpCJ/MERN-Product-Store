# MERN Product Store - Development Log

## Project Overview

A full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application for managing a product store with CRUD operations, featuring a modern UI with Chakra UI and state management with Zustand.

## Development Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Setup

1. **Initialize Node.js Project**

   - Created `package.json` with Express.js dependencies
   - Set up basic project structure with backend folder

2. **Database Configuration**

   - Created `config/db.js` for MongoDB connection using Mongoose
   - Implemented connection handling with error management
   - Added environment variable support for MongoDB URI

3. **Data Model Design**

   - Created `models/product.model.js` with Mongoose schema
   - Defined Product schema with name, price, image fields (all required)
   - Enabled automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)

4. **API Routes & Controllers**

   - Built `controllers/product.controller.js` with CRUD operations:
     - `getProducts()` - Fetch all products
     - `createProduct()` - Add new product with validation
     - `updateProduct()` - Modify existing product
     - `deleteProduct()` - Remove product by ID
   - Created `routes/product.route.js` defining Express routes
   - Mapped routes to controller functions with proper HTTP methods

5. **Server Setup**
   - Configured `server.js` as main entry point
   - Set up Express middleware (CORS, JSON parsing)
   - Connected database on server start
   - Configured API routes under `/api/products`
   - Started server on specified port

### Phase 2: Frontend Setup

6. **React Application Initialization**

   - Created Vite-based React frontend
   - Set up project structure with components, pages, store folders
   - Configured Chakra UI for styling and theming

7. **State Management**

   - Implemented Zustand store in `store/product.js`
   - Created actions for CRUD operations with API integration
   - Added optimistic UI updates for better user experience
   - Implemented error handling and success feedback

8. **Core Components**

   - Built `Navbar.jsx` with navigation and theme toggle
   - Created `ProductCard.jsx` with product display and edit/delete functionality
   - Added modal-based product editing interface

9. **Page Components**

   - Developed `HomePage.jsx` for product listing with responsive grid
   - Created `CreatePage.jsx` for new product form with validation
   - Implemented empty state handling and navigation

10. **App Structure**
    - Set up `App.jsx` with React Router configuration
    - Configured main entry point in `main.jsx` with providers
    - Integrated Chakra UI and routing throughout the application

### Phase 3: Documentation & Polish

11. **Code Documentation**

    - Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all backend files
    - Documented React components with inline comments
    - Explained state management patterns and API integration
    - Added usage examples and parameter descriptions

12. **UI/UX Enhancements**
    - Implemented responsive design with mobile-first approach
    - Added hover effects and smooth transitions
    - Integrated dark/light theme support
    - Created intuitive user feedback with toast notifications

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Chakra UI, React Router
